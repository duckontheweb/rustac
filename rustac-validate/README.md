# RuSTAC

Rust(y) tools for working with the [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)] spec. 

**WARNING:** I am brand new to Rust (this is my first real Rust project). Any feedback on code structure and/or style is more than welcome.

## Crates

* [`stac-core`](./stac-core) - Primitive types for working with STAC entities
* [`stac-validate`](./stac-validate) - Tools for validating STAC entities using [`jsonschema`]
